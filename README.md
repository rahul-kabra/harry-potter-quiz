# Harry Potter Quiz - A fun JavaScript quiz based on Harry Potter characters illustrated in the form of periodic table ⚡

The Harry Potter series is undoubtedly a fan favorite all over the world. 😊 The more we read the books or watched the movies, the more we desired to get that priceless Hogwarts letter. 🤩 Ah, the wizardry magic. 🔮

Also, we had our fair share of encounters with the ` Periodic Table ⚗️ ` and the unique chemical reactions that ensued thereafter. 🎯

So, I ventured out and decided to make an amalgamation of the above two and the result is down below. 😎
